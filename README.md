Notes from my research for forest-lang

Interesting papers:

[Programming with Abstract Data Types by Liskov & Zilles](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136.3043&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

> An abstract data type defines a class of abstract objects which is completely characterized by the operations available on those objects.

[Oberon – The Overlooked Jewel by Michael Franz](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.90.7173&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

> In order to find the optimal cost/benefit ratio, Wirth used a highly intuitive metric, the origin of which is unknown to me but that may very well be Wirth’s own invention. He used the compiler’s self-compilation speed as a measure of the compiler’s quality. Considering that Wirth’s compilers were written in the languages they compiled, and that compilers are substantial and non-trivial pieces of software in their own right, this introduced a highly practical benchmark that directly contested a compiler's complexity against its performance. Under the self- compilation speed benchmark, only those optimizations were allowed to be incorporated into a compiler that accelerated it by so much that the intrinsic cost of the new code addition was fully compensated.
